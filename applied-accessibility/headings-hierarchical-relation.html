    <p>
      Headings (h1 through h6 elements) are workhorse tags that help provide
      structure and labeling to your content. Screen readers can be set to read
      only the headings on a page so the user gets a summary. This means it is
      important for the heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and
      relate to each other, not be picked merely for their size values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Semantic meaning means that the tag you use around content indicates the
      type of information it contains.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you were writing a paper with an introduction, a body, and a
      conclusion, it wouldn't make much sense to put the conclusion as a
      subsection of the body in your outline. It should be its own section.
      Similarly, the heading tags in a webpage need to go in order and indicate
      the hierarchical relationships of your content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Headings with equal (or higher) rank start new implied sections, headings
      with lower rank start subsections of the previous one.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, a page with an h2 element followed by several subsections
      labeled with h4 tags would confuse a screen reader user. With six choices,
      it's tempting to use a tag because it looks better in a browser, but you
      can use CSS to edit the relative sizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      One final point, each page should always have one (and only one) h1
      element, which is the main subject of your content. This and the other
      headings are used in part by search engines to understand the topic of the
      page.

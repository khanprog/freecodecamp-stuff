            <strong>Introduction</strong>
            <dd>
              Abdur Rahmān Mohmand (1632–1706) (Pashto: عبدالرحمان بابا‎), or
              Rahmān Bābā (Pashto: رحمان بابا‎), was a renowned Pashtun Sufi
              Dervish and poet from Peshawar in the Mughal Empire (modern-day
              Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan). He, along with his contemporary
              Khushal Khan Khattak, is considered one of the most popular poets
              among the Pashtuns. His poetry expresses a peaceful mystical side
              of local culture which is becoming increasingly threatened by less
              tolerant interpretations of Islam.

            <strong>Rahman's lineage</strong>
            <dd>
              Rahman Baba was a Mohmand sub-tribe of Ghoryakhel Pashtun, a group
              of people who migrated from the Hindu Kush mountains to the
              Peshawar valley, between 13th to 16th century. He grew up in a
              small pocket of Mohmand settlers on the outskirts of Peshawar.
              Rahman apparently lived peacefully in the area, and never mentions
              his involvement in the fierce intertribal conflicts of his day.
              Opinion is divided about Rahman's family background. Several
              commentators are convinced that his family was village Malik
              (chieftains). However, Rahman Baba was more likely to have been a
              simple, though learned man. As he himself claimed: "Though the
              wealthy drink water from a golden cup, I prefer this clay bowl of
              mine." Abdur Rahman Baba died in 1715 CE, and his tomb is housed
              in a large domed shrine, or mazar, on the southern outskirts of
              Peshawar. The site of his grave is a popular place for poets and
              mystics to collect to recite his popular poetry. In April each
              year, there is a larger gathering to celebrate his anniversary.

            <strong>Published work</strong>
            <dd>
              A collection of Rahman's poetry, called the Dīwān ("anthology") of
              Rahman Baba, contains 343 poems, most of which are written in his
              native Pashto. The Dīwān of Rahman Baba was in wide circulation by
              1728. There are over 25 original hand-written manuscripts of the
              Dīwān scattered in various libraries worldwide, including ten in
              the Pashto Academy in Peshawar, four in the British Library, three
              in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, as well as copies in the
              John Rylands Library in Manchester, the Bodleian Library in Oxford
              and the University Library Aligath. The first printed version was
              collected by the Anglican Missionary T.P. Hughes and printed in
              Lahore in 1877. It is this version which remains the most
              commonly used to this day.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A poem by Rahman Baba translated into English:
        </h3>
        <pre>
          Sow flowers so your surroundings become a garden,
          Don’t sow thorns; for they will prick your feet,
          If you shoot arrows at others, 
          Know that the same arrow will come back to hit you. 
          Don’t dig a well in another’s path,
          In case you come to the wells edge,
          You look at everyone with hungry eyes,
          But you will be first to become mere dirt. 
          Humans are all one body,
          Whoever tortures another, wounds himself.
        </pre>
